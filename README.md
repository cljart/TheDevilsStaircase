# TheDevilsStaircase

Inspired by this [video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZTaiDHqs5s) we implemented the algorithm in SonicPi with Ruby.  

If you want to try it out install [Sonic Pi] (http://sonic-pi.net/) and copy the code from the ```devils_staircase.rb``` into your Sonic Pi workspace and run it.

Goal: Turn it into Clojure and use Overtone for real instruments.
